Gneral Info
===========
We, as a group, have chosen to embark on our group project in the domain of “speech 
emotion recognition” for specific reasons. One of the primary motivations behind our choice is 
the growing importance and relevance of this field in various applications and industries. 
Additionally, we believe that our exploration of speech emotion recognition will not just deepen 
our comprehension of the technology but will also grant us valuable perspectives into the ever-
changing realm of human-computer interaction, affective computing, and the prospects for 
enhancing user experiences across diverse scenarios. By embarking on this project, we aim to 
contribute to the body of knowledge in this area and develop practical applications that can 
make a positive impact in fields. A challenge for this project will be assuring that the data is not 
skewed and stays uniform after extracting the features from each file. Male voices could give 
higher feature values while female voices could give lower feature values but result in the same 
class label (emotion).
